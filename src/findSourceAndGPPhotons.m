%Problems:
% Rough cut isnt working, its letting in too many photons
% Also, data is only 5 columns. Its coded this way at the begining of this
% file. Not a big deal to fix.



% ^^
% Fixed it.
% Problem was that the values were not in Aitoff projection.
% However, new caviate is that my Aitoff goes from -180 to 180 deg, whereas ds9 Aitoff is from 180 to 360 then 0 to 180.
